    "content": "In the beginning of this chapter, King Yudhisthira approached Lord Krishna and revealed his disparing heart. Lord Krishna encouraged him with assuring words, and thus King Yudhisthira was enlivened to continue the battle. All of us are in the battle of material existence, and  material nature is so overwhelming, we need to turn to Lord Krishna for help. Some may say that we don't have Lord Krishna present to pour out our hearts to, but that is not the case. Lord Krishna is present in our hearts, and He knows our determination and our sorrows. If we turn to Him and reveal our hearts, He will help as he did King Yudhisthira. We can feel the presence of the Lord by chanting the Hare Krishna maha mantra, Hare Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. In the Bhagavad-gita Lord Krishna assured Arjuna, cetasa sarva karmani, mayi sannyasya mat-parah, buddhi-yogam upashritya, mach chittah sattam bhava, \"In all activities just depend upon Me and work always under My protection. In such devotional service, be fully conscious of Me.\" (B.g. 18.57) In the next verse Lord Krishna continues, mac cittah sarva-durgani, mat-prasadat tarisyasi, atha cet tvam ahankaran, na shrosyasi vinanksyasi, \"If you become conscious of Me, you will pass over all obstacles of conditional life by My grace. If, however, you do not work in such consciousness but act through false ego, no hearing Me, you will be lost.\" (B.g. 18.58)"
