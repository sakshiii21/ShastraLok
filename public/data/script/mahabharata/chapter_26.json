    "content": "A pure devotee like Vidura is the well wisher of all living beings. He was always looking after the welfare of the Pandavas just like the eye lid protects the eye. Vidura was the incarnation of Yamaraja, religion personified, one of the twelve mahajanas. He had been cursed by Mandavya Muni to take birth as a Shudra. However, that did not stop him from being a self realized soul. There is nothing that can impede pure devotional service. Therefore, it doesn't matter what family or what caste one is born in. What matters is how much devotion a person has developed. Lord Krishna is only attracted by pure devotion.\nLord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has instructed us that any one can become a spiritual master if he knows the science of Krishna consciousness. This is open to the man or the woman, the young or the old, the brahmana or the Shudra, the black or the white. Mirabhai was a famous vaishnavi guru in a woman's body. Her devotion and bhajans are famous throughout India. Prahlada Maharaja was only a five year old boy when he instructed his school mates in the science of devotional service. His prayers to Lord Nrisimhadeva detail the most profound devotion. One can find a great devotee in any section of society."
