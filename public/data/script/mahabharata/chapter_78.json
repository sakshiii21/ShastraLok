    "content": "Before this age of Kali, some five thousand years ago, the earth had become overburdened with military forces antagonistic to the will of the Lord. At Brahma's request the Lord descended to decrease this burden. When the Lord descends so do His associates to assist him. The Pandavas were assistants to decrease the military burden. King Susharman was antagonistic to the will of the Lord, and later, in the great battle of the Bharatas, we will see how Arjuna kills him.\nIn the age of Kali practically everyone is infected with demoniac qualities. It is not possible to kill everyone so the Lord descends as Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and annihilates the demoniac mentality with the chanting of the Hare Krishna maha mantra, Hare Krishna Hare Krishna, Krishna Krishna, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare Hare. This transcendental sound has be chosen to cleanse the heart of all impurities in this fallen age. This is confirmed in the Kali Santarana Upanishad, \"The sixteen words of the Hare Krishna mantra are especially meant for counteracting the sins of the age of Kali. To save oneself from the contamination of this age there is no alternative but to chant the Hare Krishna mantra. After searching through all the Vedic literatures one cannot find a method of religion for this age so sublime as the chanting of Hare Krishna.\" (Kali-Santarana Upanishad 5-6) This is part of a conversation where Lord Brahma instructs Narada muni."
