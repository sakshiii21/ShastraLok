    "content": "Dhritarastra was truly blind in all respects, both spiritually and materially. Due to his affection for his deceitful son, he could not understand the right path to take. Althought given good advice by Bhishma, Drona and Vidura, still he could not give up his affection for Duryodhana. Duryodhana attracted persons of the same mentality. Shakuni, Karna, Duhsasana, Asvatthama and others were deceitful by nature and were not fit persons to rule the world or act as advisers. As this age of Kali yuga progressed, kings of the Duryodhana mentality gained power. Because of their devious nature the citizens lost faith in them. As seen in this chapter the citizens were cursing Dhritarastra and Duryodhana for their conspiracy to kill the Pandavas. As this age progresses, things will get worse and worse.\nIn this material world there is always some happiness and distress.  we gain something and again we lose it. There is always some upheaval. The dualities of the material world exist as long as we identify with the material body. If we think that we are this body, we will be disturbed by happiness and distress, heat and cold, honor and dishonor, etc. The symptom of a liberated soul is that he is transcendental to these temporary situations. The Pandavas, as we will see, are about to lose their acquired kingdom. However, because they took shelter of Lord Krishna in all circumstances, their so called distress turned out to be happiness. For liberated souls there is never distress as we experience it in this world."
