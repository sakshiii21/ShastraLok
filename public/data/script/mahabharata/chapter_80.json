    "content": "Arjuna was like the full moon in the sky. He was an empowered representative of the Lord. It is stated in the Chaitanya Charitamrita, krishna shakti vina nahe tara pravartana, \"Unless empowered by the Lord one cannot propagate the Lord's mission.\" (C.c. Antya 7.11) One who receives the Lord's empowerment is called a shaktavesha avatara.Arjuna was empowered to relieve the earth's burden in the form numerous military divisions. Arjuna alone killed many millions and millions of men during his lifetime, but it was all for the service of the Lord. We have seen in the life of our spiritual master, His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada, that he alone came to the Western world to spread the Krishna consciousness movement. Because he surrendered everything, the Lord Krishna empowered him to spread this movement and to lighten the earth's burden in the form of demoniac mentality. Shrila Prabhupada carried with him the empowerment of chanting the Hare Krishna maha mantra. He made this transcendental sound vibration a household word throughout the entire world. If one becomes empowered by the Lord, he can do wondrous and marvelous things that no ordinary human can perform, as we have heard from this chapter."
