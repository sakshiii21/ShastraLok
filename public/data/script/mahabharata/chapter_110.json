    "content": "During this 's confrontation, Bhishma is again killing the Pandava troops in large numbers, and seeing Arjuna unwilling to fight with his grandfather, Lord Krishna takes up a weapon to fight with Bhishma. Lord Krishna promised not to fight before the battle. One would expect the Supreme Lord to follow His vow. If the Lord Lord cannot keep His vow then how can He expect us to? The Lord is not breaking His promise for His own gratification, but to protect He unalloyed devotees. The Pandavas were in a desperate situation, and Lord Krishna took up His Sudarshana Chakra to protect the Pandava Army. The Lord is setting an example here that one can break his promise if it is for the satisfaction of Guru and Krishna. If one breaks his promise or vow and Lord Krishna is satisfied, then that is true morality. One should see how far Lord Krishna is satisfied.\nGadadhar Pandit, a follower and disciple of Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, took a vow of Kshetra sannyasa, a vow of not leaving a holy place. When Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu wanted leave for Vrindavana from Jagannatha Puri, Gadadhar Pandit wanted to go with Him, but the Lord forbade him to come. Gadadhar Pandit actually accompanied Lord Chaitanya Mahaprabhu a short distance from Jagannatha Puri, and the Lord was not pleased, and ultimately sent him back. On the other hand, Ramanujacharya received a mantra from his guru and took a vow not to tell anyone. However, Ramanuja went to the rooftops and yelled the mantra for everyone to hear. Ultimately, the townspeople became Krishna conscious by the mantra, and Ramanujachary's guru was pleased. One cannot be attached to mundane morality, but to the satisfaction of guru and Krishna."
