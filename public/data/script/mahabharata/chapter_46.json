    "content": "King Yudhisthira consistently shows the true qualities of a King. He did not want perform the Rajasuya sacrifice without consulting with the Supreme Lord. This is the example set by this great king. No leader should make important decisions without consulting with the Supreme Lord. The leader of a nation is supposed to be so pious as to have direct contact with the Lord for instituting the will of the Lord. Saintly kings like Dasaratha, Janaka, Yudhisthira, David, Solomon and others had direct communication with the Lord due to their being obedient servants of the Lord. The Lord reveals Himself to one who is surrendered and obedient.\nKing Yudhisthira was actually afraid to act for his personal sense gratification. To perform this sacrifice would mean that he would be the emperor of the world. It would mean that kings from all subordinated kingdoms would come and bow their heads at his feet. King Yudhisthira did not want this position unless the Supreme Lord sanctioned it. Maharaja Yudhisthira was a self realized soul. He had no need to be emperor of the world. He simple wanted to glorify Lord Krishna and surrender to His supreme will.\nLord Krishna again saved the Pandavas by instructing Bhima how to kill Jarasandha. Jarasandha was undefeatable by a mortal being. Even Bhima, the son of the Wind God, Vayu, had a difficult time killing Jarasandha. Lord Krishna entered Bhima's body by His personal strength and empowered him to kill Jarasandha, who was otherwise undefeatable. No one can thwart the will of the Lord. Lord Krishna and Balarama had descended on a mission to kill those who were opposed to religiosity. Jarasandha and demons like him were opposed to Krishna's plan and thus destined to be destroyed."
