    "content": "From the movement of millions upon millions of troops, we can see the level of management needed to organize such a massive battle. This is hardly possible for primitive civilizations. The amount of weapon, tents, food, water, doctors etc. is mind boggling. To, we are being brain washed into believing that man is progressing, but in comparision to the Vedic historical records, man is regressing in this age of Kali. His memory, life span, bodily strength, luck, religious and pious activities all diminish in Kali Yuga. As this age progresses, more and more hellish enviorments will be created because of sinful activities. The best alternative is not to take birth again in this world, but to develop a spiritual body fit for the kingdom of God.\n\nBhisma Parva"
