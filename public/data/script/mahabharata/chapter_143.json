    "content": "In this chapter there is another point concerning morality. One may criticize Arjuna for killing Karna while he was pulling his chariot from the mud. However, if we remember from the Adi Parva, Karna was cursed by a brahmana to be killed while his chariot wheel was stuck in the earth. Arjuna was the instrument to fulfill that curse. According to the code of warfare, an enemy should not be killed when he is not properly armed, and Karna requested that Arjuna not kill him till his chariot was out of the earth. However, Lord Krishna reminded Karna of his lack of virtue and morality, and asked him why he was now requesting mercy, when he previously gave none. If Lord Krishna requested Arjuna not to show mercy to Karna, then that is the highest morality. Karna surely attained an exalted destination for seeing Lord Krishna and Arjuna at the last moment of his life. Lord Krishna informed Arjuna before the battle, anta-kale ca mam eva, smaran muktva kalevaram, yah prayati sa mad-bhavam, yati nasty atra samsayah, \"And whoever, at the time of death, quits his body, remembering Me alone, at once attains My nature. Of this there is no doubt.\" (B.g. 8.5) Karna was fortunate to be killed while looking at Lord Krishna, the Supreme Personality of Godhead.\nOne may also criticize Bhima for drinking the blood from Duhshasana's chest. It will be learned later that Bhima never actually drank the blood, but put his mouth on Duhshasana's chest, giving the apparent scene of drinking Duhshasana's blood. Bhima certainly looked ghastly as he rose from Duhshasana's body, but that is the vow he took at the gambling match, since Duhshasana forcibly grabbed his wife, Draupadi, and tried to strip her naked. The sinful are always punished, eventually, in one way or another.\n\nSalya Parva"
