    "content": "Shrila Vyasadeva spoke words of wisdom when he advised the Pandavas not to lament their fate. Even though it seemed to be a tragic incident, still the Lord had a plan to glorify His devotee. No one understands the inconceivable plan of the Lord. Vyasa prophesied that the Pandavas, in the future, would gain a great kingdom and become famous for all time. The words of the sage would not prove otherwise.  the Lord puts us through the dark night of the soul so that we can learn to depend completely on His mercy. We should not depend on any other living being. The Pandavas were already eternally liberated souls and knew this fact, but the Lord put them through these trying circumstances to show us how to act. It would be during these distressful times that the Pandavas would kill demons like Hidimva and Baka and win Draupadi as a wife and gain an alliance with Drupada. \"All things work together for good to them who love God.  (St. Paul) Even distressful situations turn out for the good for a surrendered soul. Because a devotee gives his life for the service of the Lord, the Lord guides his devotee in all circumstances."
