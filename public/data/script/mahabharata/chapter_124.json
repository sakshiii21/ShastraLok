    "content": "Because Duryodhana could not defeat Abhimanyu fairly, he had to resort to cheating methods and relied on his old sinister friend, Shakuni. It was Shakuni's idea to attack Abhimanyu from behind. Demons cannot fight by fair means. The very nature of the demoniac mentality is cheating. Duryodhana had been cheating the Pandavas since they were little boys, and he wasn't about to stop. Whatever would further his cause, he would accept even if it meant attacking Abhimanyu from behind, which is against the rules of warfare. Duryodhana could not understand that every previous member of the Kuru dynasty was a spotless exalted king who earned their name and fame by performing good deeds. Unfortunately, he did not have the mentality of a rajarshi, or saintly king, and thus his name would go down in history among demoniac kings like Ravana, Vena, Jarasandha, Kamsa, Shishupala, Shalva, Dantavakra etc."
