    "content": "King Dhritarastra had planned to kill the Pandavas by burning them in a house of lac. This so-called reversal for the Pandavas turned out to be a benediction, because they acquired Draupadi as their wife, and they developed a more intimate friendship with Lord Krishna, the Supreme Person. They also acquired an alliance with the most powerful King Drupada. The devotees of the Lord never lament when reversals come upon them. They take these reversals as the mercy of God. As stated in the Shrimad Bhagavatam, \"One who seeks Your compassion and thus tolerates all kinds of adverse conditions due to the karma of his past deeds, who engages always in Your devotional service with his mind, words and body, and who always offers obeisances unto You, is certainly a bona fide candidate for liberation.  (S.B.10.14.8) This is part of Lord Brahma's prayers to Lord Krishna. Brahma offered prayers to Lord Krishna after he had been humbled by Lord Krishna's mystic potency. This quotation explains how we should accept reversals. When impediments come to a devotee, he does not complain, but continues his service to the Lord, knowing that he must be given a slight punishment for sins committed in the past. No harm can ever come to a devotee and even seeming reversals turn out favorable in the end.\nIn Vedic culture all actions were seen through the eye of scripture. Vedic culture was set up to elevate a person to a high standard of life. By following the Vedic injunctions a person could prosper both materially and spiritually. King Drupada had a doubt, and rightly so, about marrying his daugther to five men, because this was not sanctioned by scripture. In the Vedic times the kings were trained in sastra so they could lead society on the right path. It is unfortunate that to all scripture has been taken out of the schools on the basis of a secular society. Even in India, the mother land of religion, Bhagavad-gita is no longer taught in the school system. It is no wonder then that the youth are imitating the westerners and taking up a life of sense gratification that will lead them to an animal birth in the next life."
