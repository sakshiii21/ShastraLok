    "content": "Lord Krishna displayed such opulence that only He could manifest. Parashara Muni has defined the Lord as full in six opulences: all wealth, all fame, all knowledge, all renunciation, all power and all beauty. These s we have trouble maintaining one wife, but here we see the Lord arranged a procession of 16,108 queens along with His children and servants. The Lord manifests such opulence, and He doesn't have to labor to do it. By His divine potency and will everything is arranged. In the ninth chapter of Bhagavad-gita Lord Krishna tells Arjuna, \"The whole cosmic order is under Me. By My will it is manifested again and again, and by My will it is annihilated at the end.\" The Lord simply desires and everything takes place.\nThe living beings in this world have to struggle hard to survive. They cannot simply desire and get what they want. It is said in the Bible that the Lord cursed Adam to work by the sweat of his brow for the sin of eating from the tree of knowledge. This world is a prison house for those who have rebeled in the kingdom of God. We have to work hard to gain little. In the Lord's Kingdom there are desire trees from which a person can choose whatever he likes to serve the Lord, chintamani prakara sadmansu kalpa vriksha. (B.S. 5.22) The word kalpa vriksha means desire tree from which one can choose anything that he likes. These trees do not exist in this world. However, when the Lord descends to this world, they are present in places like Vrindavana, Mathura and Dvaraka. The Lord manifests such opulences encouraging us to leave this world of woe and come back to the kingdom of God, our eternal home."
