    "content": "Maharaja Yudhisthira was able to treat everyone equally. The Mayavadi philosophers' endeavor to see everyone as God is an artificial way towards oneness, but a Vaishnava or a devotee of Lord Narayana sees every living entity as part and parcel of the Supreme Lord. Therefore, a Vaishnava's treatment of other living entities is on the absolute platform. Since one cannot treat one part of his body differently from another part because they all belong to the same body, so a Vaishnava does not see a human being as distinct from an animal because in both of them he sees the soul and the Supersoul seated simultaneously. Maharaja Yudhisthira was endowed with such a spiritual vision, and, therefore, seeing Lord Krishna in everyone's heart, he treated everyone kindly.\nOne may wonder why Lord Krishna allowed everyone to laugh at Duryodhana's foolishness if the Lord is equal to everyone. Although Duryodhana is also part and parcel of Krishna, he was acting enviously of the Pandavas. The Lord had descended to protect His devotees and to kill the envious. However, both groups got liberation. The Pandavas and other devotees got liberation by favorable devotion. Shishupala, Duryodhana, Kamsa and others got liberation by being envious of the Lord and thus being killed by the Lord. When the demons are killed by the Lord, they attain to favorable devotion and enter the kingdom of God. Thus the Lord is truly equal to all."
