    "content": "One may ask why the Pandavas took so much effort to remain concealed when they were blessed by demigods such as Yamaraja and the goddess Durga. The answer is that a devotee is always humble and never proud. Yamaraja had benedicted them they they could walk the earth in their very same forms and dress, and not be discovered. So why bother trying to hide? The Pandavas business was to remain concealed for the thirteenth year, and therefore, they followed their plan despite being benedicted by the devas. The Pandavas never thwarted their benedictions.\nOne may also ask why Yudhisthira prayed to the goddess Durga for protection from being detected. To facilitate one's service, one may pray to the demigods for help. What was Yudhisthira's service? Lord Krishna wanted him to reign as emperor of the entire world. The last year of exile had to be passed incognito before Yudhisthira could accept the throne. The Gopis prayed to the Goddess Durga to have Lord Krishna as their husband, and Yudhisthira prayed for assistance in his service to Lord Krishna. Yudhisthira never considered the Goddess Durga supreme."
