    "content": "Formerly the kings of this earth were endowed with an heroic nature. They would face the enemy and not retreat. They were convinced that by dying in battle they would attain a higher state after death. They did not sit behind the lines and command ordinary soldiers to do their work for them. We have seen in the course of history that generals began to stay behind the lines and order their soldiers to fight. These s the leader of a country doesn't even appear anywhere near the battlefield. He sits behind his comfortable desk in his capital and orders others to do the job. This is why no one has respect for modern leaders.\nBy the push of a button millions of people can be wiped out by atomic weapons, not just fighting soldiers, but innocent women, children and old men. In the glorious s of Vedic culture such barbarianism was unheard of. As we see in this pastime Arjuna and Bhima were the first ones into battle and they would not retreat. For a great warrior to leave the battlefield would cast him to shame. He would be unable to face the citizens or his relatives. This spirit of heroism and chivalry has been lost as human society regresses in quality in this age of quarrel and hypocrisy. We are not advancing in good qualities but descending into the mentality of barbarians despite so much progress in the field of technology."
