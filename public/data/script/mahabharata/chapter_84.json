    "content": "There is certainly a difference between a devotee of the Lord like Arjuna, and a materialistic person like Duryodhana. The materialist always thinks in terms of profit, and a devotee always wants to please Lord Krishna. Duryodhana had come to Krishna, not to please him, but for material benefit. Lord Krishna gave Arjuna the first choice: men or Himself. Arjuna did not think in material terms. He just want to serve Krishna and get Lord Krishna's constant association. He knew that was the perfect formula for success. Duryodhana was very happy to get an akshauhini division of soldiers, thinking that if he outnumbered Yudhisthira, he would be the victor. Materialists never take into consideration the mercy of the Lord. Arjuna was perfectly happy to have Lord Krishna's association for he knew that wherever there was Krishna, there would certainly be victory.\nDuryodhana was constantly thinking of ways to be successful materially. He tricked Salya into taking his side during the battle of Kurukshetra. It really didn't make any difference if Duryodhana had an unlimited number of akshauhini divisions, for it was the Lord's desire that Duryodhana be punished for his sinful activities. Whoever Krishna wants to kill, no one can protect, and whoever Krishna wants to save, no one can kill. Because Duryodhana was lacking any farthing of pious activity, he could never catch up this point."
