    "content": "Arjuna and the Samsaptakas fought a fierce battle. Whenever Susharman, the Trigarta King, challenged Arjuna, Arjuna would not turn his back. This was the quality of warriors in the Vedic age. The rules of warfare were there for those who wanted to attain a higher destination after this life. One may question, \"Who is witness of my activities?\" The answer is that the demigods are witnesses to our activities, and they testify to that in the court of Yamaraja after one leaves this body. If one dies following the rules of combat, one is elevated to the heavenly realm, and if one has cheated on the rules, he does not attain heaven, but is punished by Yamaraja, the justice of death. It is a shame that to's armies don't follow the rules of Vedic warfare. If the heads of state challenge each other and fight in a secluded place away from the general populace, then innocent lives are saved, and if a president dies facing the enemy on the battlefield, then he will be elevated to a higher destination."
