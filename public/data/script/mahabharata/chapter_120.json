    "content": "It has become apparent to Duryodhana that he cannot defeat the Pandava army by fair means. Therefore, in his usual conniving way he is trying to defeat them by other methods. He took their kingdom by foul play in the gambling match, and now he wants to capture Yudhisthira and force him to gamble again. Drona, also, has taken the same mentality. Although Drona is a good man, by bad association he has become contaminated. Association is like a mirror. Whoever we associate with we will become like. If we associate with saintly persons, we become saintly, and if we associate with evil persons, we become evil. The International Society for Krishna Consciousness has be set up by His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada to give common persons association with sadhus or saintly persons. By such association common persons can give up their bad habits and lead a pure life. It is stated by Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, sadhu sanga, sadhu sanga-sarva shastre kaya, lava matra sandhu sanga, sarva siddhi haya, \"The verdict of all revealed scriptures is that by even a moment's association with a pure devotee, one can attain all success.\" (Chaitanya Charitamrita Madhya 22.54)\nConversely, by lingering with evil hearted persons, one becomes contaminated. By too much association with Duryodhana, Drona has taken a similar mentality."
