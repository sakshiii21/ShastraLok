    "content": "One may question how it is possible for a devotee like Arjuna to be attracte by so many women and at the same time be a pure devotee. The devotees of Lord Krishna cannot be swayed by lust; they are free from all material desires. The answer is that Arjuna was playing the part of a kshatriya (king). All kings were married even if they were pure devotees. The role of a king is that he must be an ideal householder. It was known that King Dasaratha, the father of Lord Ramachandra, had 350 wives, but one cannot say that he was a lusty person. It was common in those s that kings take a number of wives and support them in great opulence. The pure devotees of the Lord are always under the influence of the internal energy of the Lord (yogamaya). Arjuna apparently fell under the sway of family affection just before the Kurukshetra war. He didn't want to kill his relatives. That incident happened by the will of the Lord Krishna so the Bhagavad-gita could be spoken. Similarly, these pastimes of Arjuna are not like the lustful attraction men feel for women in this world, although they appear to be so. Arjuna's gusto to get Subhadra as his wife is because of her relationship to Lord Krishna. Arjuna's attraction for Krishna was far greater than the attraction of any woman of this world. An aspiring devotee cannot imitate Arjuna and at the same time think himself a follower of Lord Krishna. There is a class of people called sahajiyas who imitate Krishna's dancing with the gopis. They engage in illicit sex and at the same time think themselves liberated. Lord Krishna's rasa dance was free from any tinge of lust. We must be very careful in judging eternally liberated souls; we have to follow their instructions and not imitate them."
