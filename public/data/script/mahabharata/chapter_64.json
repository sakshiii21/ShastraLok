    "content": "Lord Krishna loved the Pandavas so much that He  lived with them in the forest. The Pandavas did not request Lord Krishna to relieve their suffering condition. Yudhisthira accepted the loss of his kingdom as destiny and did not complain to Lord Krishna. He could have requested Lord Krishna to fight with Duryodhana and gain back his kingdom, but he didn't. A devotee can accept any condition as the mercy of the Lord. The Pandavas are pure devotees and eternal associates of the Lord; so one may ask why the Lord put them in that condition of life? He did so to show the conditioned souls in this world how to act in times of calamity. By setting the proper example common persons will know how to act. Everyone in this world has been transmigrating through many species of life. In the human form we have committed many sinful activities for which we have to suffer. When a conditioned soul comes to Krishna, the Lord takes his karma and minimizes it. The devotee only receives a token reaction for his past sins and that is given directly by the Lord. Therefore, a devotee should not complain, but thank the Lord for giving a small punishment.\nThe Lord always promises to protect his devotees. In this chapter Lord Krishna told Arjuna, \"You are Mine, and I am yours....He who hates you, also hates Me, and he who follows you, also follows Me.\" With this loving reciprocation, there was no chance for Duryodhana to be victorious. Duryodhana could have had a hundred or a thousand Bhishma's on his side; still he would have lost. When Lord Krishna agrees to protect someone, nothing can harm that person. If Lord Krishna does not protect someone, no one can save that person. Because Bhishma did not take the side of the Pandavas, he was destined to die because he did not receive the protection of Lord Krishna."
