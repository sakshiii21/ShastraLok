    "content": "The Pandavas, obviously, were not interested in war. Yudhisthira requested his kingdom of Indraprastha, and he was willing to overlook all offenses. However, Duryodhana was not interested in peace. Even after he heard the glories of Lord Krishna, he was not willing for peace. He was a determined demon and headed for certain death. This shows that personal association with the Lord is not everything. Many demons had the association of Lord Krishna, but could not surrender to the will of the Lord. Personal association with the Lord is not as important as a pure heart. Those with pure hearts can see the Lord within, and thus they have the constant association of the Lord. This is confirmed in the Brahma Samhita, premanjana cchurita-bhakti-vilochanena, santah sadaiva hrieshu viokayanti, yam shyamasundarm achintya-guna-svarupam, govindam adi purusham tam aham bhajami, I worship Govinda, the primeval Lord, who is Shyamasundar, Krishna Himself, with inconceivable, innumerable attributes, whom the pure devotee see with heart of hearts with the eye of devotion tinged with the salve of love.  (B.S. 5.38)"
