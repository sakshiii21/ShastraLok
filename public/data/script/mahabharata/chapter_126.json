    "content": "Upon the death of Abhimanyu there was much lamentation in the camp of the Pandavas, so much so that Vyasadeva had to appear and preach to King Yudhisthira. He fell into illusion much similar to the way Arjuna fell into illusion before the battle of Kurukshetra. One can be under the Yogamaya potency (divine potency of the Lord) or the Mahamaya potency (deluding potency of the Lord). The difference being that one under Mahamaya falls into deeper separation from the Lord when calamities appear, and one who has fallen under Yogamaya potency increase his attachment for the Lord when disaster happens. Through this whole episode we will see how the Pandavas increase their attachment for Lord Krishna. There was some temporary despondency at the death of Abhimanyu, but this only caused the Pandavas to increase their service attitude toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The Pandavas were only instruments for the Lord's purpose of decreasing the burden of the earth. To fulfill the Lord's desire, Arjuna had to increase his anger toward the sinners. The unfair death of Abhimanyu was the catalyst to fulfill the Lord's desire.\nIn this chapter Lord Krishna again stated his loving attachment for Arjuna. He told His charioteer, Daruka, \"I cannot live on Earth without Arjuna. If necessary I will take up weapons against the Kauravas so Arjuna can keep his vow.\" By serving Lord Krishna one gradually increases his attachment for the Lord so much so that the Lord agrees to carry what we lack. Before the battle Lord Krishna told Arjuna, ananyas cintayanto mam, ye janah paryupasate, tesam nityabhiyuktanam, yoga-kshemam vahamy aham, \"But those who worship Me with devotion, meditating on My transcendental form-to them I carry what they lack and preserve what they have.\" (B.g. 9.22) Always thinking of Krishna is the best insurance policy we could have. He is our eternal father and the protector of His devotees."
