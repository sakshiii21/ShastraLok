    "content": "Duryodhana has now eaten the bitter fruit of Vaishnava aparadha. Lord Shri Chaitanya Mahaprabhu has warned us about offending Vaishnavas. He instructed Rupa Goswami that there is a seed of devotional service which is planted in the heart, and it is watered by the process of hearing and chanting about Krishna. That seed sprouts into a creeper which must be protected. The greatest offense and annihilator of the devotional creeper is Vaishnava aparadha which is compared to a mad elephant. An elephant can destroy a small creeper very easily, and offending a Vaishnava is compared to letting an elephant loose in a small garden. The result is devastation. Duryodhana planted the seed of Vaishnava aparadha, and that seed grew into a creeper which eventually produced the bitter fruit of his death at the hands of Bhima. One should learn from the events of Mahabharata that one should not offend Vaishnavas.\n\nSauptika Parva"
