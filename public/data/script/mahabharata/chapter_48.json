    "content": "The imprisoned kings could easily see the result of misusing political power. As soon as a king or a nation becomes rich in material opulences, it wants to dominate other nations by military aggression. Similarly, mercantile men want to monopolize a certain type of business and control other mercantile groups. Degraded by false prestige and infatuated by material opulences, human society, instead of striving for Krishna consciousness, creates havoc and disrupts peaceful living. Thus men naturally forget the real purpose of life: to attain the favor of Lord Vishnu, the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is unfortunate that living beings have to learn the hard way. If we simply by follow the instructions of Lord Krishna, peaceful living automatically follows.\nIn Lord Krishna's instructions to the imprisoned kings, he gives the perfect example of a Krishna conscious society. If the people of the world divide the whole society, into four orders for material and spiritual progress, and following the instructions of Krishna as stated in Bhagavad-gita, the entire human society will undoubtedly be happy. Presently people don't know how to be happy. Because, by ignoring the instructions of the Lord and guided by their personal motivations, they have created hell on earth. Five thousand years ago the earth needed a cleansing of evil kings, and so also, to, the earth needs a thorough cleansing of the ungodly. Once this is done, the earth will again begin to prosper under God conscious leadership."
