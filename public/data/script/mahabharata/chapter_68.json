    "content": "Another benediction has been obtained by the Pandavas, so how can they be defeated by the Kurus. Whenever one gets the blessings of Vaishnavas, brahmanas and other worshipable superiors, how can there ever be any ill fortune? We must follow in the footsteps of the Pandavas and try for blessings and benedictions from the Vaishnavas for preaching Krishna consciousness in this difficult age of Kali. When the Lord's pure devotees are pleased with our service then certainly Lord Krishna will remove any impediments from our devotional path."
